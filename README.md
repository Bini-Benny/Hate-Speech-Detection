# Hate-Speech-Detection
### Overview
Hate speech has become a major global concern due to its pervasive growth on social media platforms. Creating safer and more inclusive online environments requires the swift identification and mitigation of the detrimental impacts of hate speech. This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in detecting hate speech on social media.
### Objective
The primary objective of this study is to compare the accuracy and robustness of:

Traditional Machine Learning Models: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

Sophisticated Deep Learning Models: BERT and RoBERTa.

### Key Findings
RoBERTa:

Achieved the highest accuracy of 93.74%, surpassing all other models.

Demonstrated superior ability in handling the intricate and context-specific characteristics of hate speech.

BERT:

Showed significant promise but required additional training epochs to reach its full potential.

Traditional ML Models:

Models such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression were less effective in dealing with the nuanced and contextual nature of hate speech.
